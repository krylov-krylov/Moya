Contract module which acts as a timelocked controller.
This gives time for users of the controlled contract to exit before a potentially dangerous maintenance operation is applied.
If emergency mode of the zkevm contract system is active, this timelock have no delay.

## Functions
### constructor
```solidity
  function constructor(
    uint256 minDelay,
    address[] proposers,
    address[] executors,
    address admin,
    contract PolygonZkEVM _polygonZkEVM
  ) public
```
Constructor of timelock


#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`minDelay` | uint256 | initial minimum delay for operations
|`proposers` | address[] | accounts to be granted proposer and canceller roles
|`executors` | address[] | accounts to be granted executor role
|`admin` | address | optional account to be granted admin role; disable with zero address
|`_polygonZkEVM` | contract PolygonZkEVM | polygonZkEVM address


### getMinDelay
```solidity
  function getMinDelay(
  ) public returns (uint256 duration)
```

Returns the minimum delay for an operation to become valid.

This value can be changed by executing an operation that calls `updateDelay`.
If Polygon ZK-EVM is on emergency state the minDelay will be 0 instead.
